# AIN Responsive Email Template

For general newsletters that don't need a lot of flashy stuff, use this.

Preview: http://leemunroe.github.io/html-email-template/email.html

### Sending emails using a marketing service like Campaign Monitor or Mailchimp?

Use the template as is. They'll put the CSS inline for you when you put together your campaign.


### Sending emails directly from your app or using a developer service like Mailgun?

You need to put the CSS inline. You can use [Premailer](http://premailer.dialect.ca/) to do this automatically.

* Copy all of email.html
* Paste the HTML as the source into Premailer
* Copy the HTML results and use them in your email view/template

### Tried and tested
Tested on all major email clients. Mobile, desktop and web. Originally forked from https://github.com/leemunroe/html-email-template. I only AIN'ed this.
